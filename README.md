A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently. A data structure is not only used for organizing the data. It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data. There are different basic and advanced types of data structures that are used in almost every program or software system that has been developed.
So we must have good knowledge about data structures.

In this project, I am working on various Data Structure techniques's questions and problems. I aim to learn new solutions and tackle Data Structure in different programming languages challenges ranging from basic to advanced levels. I am also utilizing algorithms for some of these problems. Additionally, I am trying to learn how to solve more complex problems and apply these skills to real-world scenarios.

[ In this project, I am also trying to write programs to build a good project using Data Structure and algorithms. ]

## Using programming language

- Python <a href="https://www.python.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="https://s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pythondotorg-assets/media/files/python-logo-only.svg" alt="java" width="20" height="20"/>

- Java <a href="https://www.java.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/java/java-original.svg" alt="java" width="20" height="20"/>

## Objective✍️

- Make an effort to learn Array, List, sorting, Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph and more. 
- Upskill myself with new technology.
- Try to Make myself proficient in data structures and algorithms.
- Try to develop skills in a variety of areas, including artificial intelligence, Database Management, data science, machine learning, etc.
- Try to explore new things in technology using the Data Structure and algorithms methods in different programming languages.

## Work and Learning by- [ Abhay Mishra 🧑‍💻 ]

I aim to learn new solutions and tackle Data Structure methods programming challenges ranging from basic to advanced levels. Learning new methods and features in Data Structure to upskill myself. Learn how to use the Data Structure techniques in different technologies and build real-world projects.
